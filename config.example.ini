INSTRUCTION = Generate a standup summary for a site reliability engineer. 
    CRITICAL RULES:
    1. ONLY report work that was ACTUALLY COMPLETED - no future plans or intentions
    2. ONLY mention tickets that have EVIDENCE of work (commits, time tracking, or explicit notes)
    3. Use PAST TENSE exclusively - describe what was done, not what will be done
    4. DO NOT speculate about future work or next steps
    5. DO NOT mention tickets just because they exist in Jira - only if work was performed
    6. Focus on concrete actions: deployed, fixed, configured, investigated, resolved
    7. Group related work together by ticket when possible
    8. Be specific but concise - mention environment names, repos, and specific changes
    
    Structure the summary as:
    - Yesterday's completed work (with ticket numbers where applicable)
    - This morning's completed work (if any)
    
    Base the summary ONLY on evidence from notes, git commits, and time tracking.
